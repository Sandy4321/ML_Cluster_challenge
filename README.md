# ML_Cluster_challenge

## 1. Purpose and project objective 

### Purpose 
- [x] Find chipotle epicentres to live your ideal chipotle lifestyle by clustering the chipotle dataset.

### Objectives 

- [x] Consolidate the knowledge in Python, specifically in : NumPy, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib,...
- [x] visualization: to be able to use geopandas, matplotlib (and seaborn) to visualize clustered data onto a map
- [x] Consolidate knowledge of data science and machine learning algorithm for developping an accurate clustering model
- [x] data analysis: to be able to determine appropriate clustering methods and variables to cluster
- [x] data analysis: to evaluate the chosen clustering method in comparison to other methods

### Features 
#### Must-have 
- [x] A visualisation of the USA with chipotle locations
- [x] Visualization of the different clusters
- [x] Intrinsic analysis comparison of the clusters of at least 2 methods with varying arguments (using euclidian distance as criteria)
- [x] A chosen centroid to live. Make your argument of why the chosen centroid is superior to others.

#### Nice-to-Have
- [x] Colour coded cluster visualisation
- [x] Clear graph legends

### Context of the project 
- [x] All the work achieved was done during the BeCode's AI/data science bootcamp 2020-2021

## 2. The project 

### Notebooks
- [x] [Data cleaning and preparation]()
- [x] Notebook on [cluster analyses]()

### Ouput samples

- [x] Elbow method for choosing the right number of clusters
